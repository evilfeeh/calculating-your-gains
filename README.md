## Explanation

In 2016, I wrote my first code. It was a simple calculator, done in PHP. Six years after, I decided to rewrite in JS, putting a new skin on the project.

I don't have plans to keep this project, but my anxious side feels the call of refactor, so here we are.

I had some ideas as a water level calculator and do some sugestions to eat. But the React took a lot of time, so I decided move to new projects.
